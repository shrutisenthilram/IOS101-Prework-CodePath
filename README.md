## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Favorite Applications: 
1. Instagram: I love the location of all the buttons on instagram, I think it's designed very well with user experience in mind.
2. Stardust: It's a period tracking app, and I think the designers of the app did a very good job with the overall aesthetic and theme .
3. Notion: I like the functionality of the application.

I would like to make an app about financial literacy. As a new college student, having a good sense of financial literacy is so important. 
However, it's hard to find one good resource and get all your information from there. With a fiancial literacy app, it would be easier for people to 
access this informaiton. This would include a lot of different information not only about money management, but also investment and more.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

It took me some time to adjust to the different structure of Xcode because I didnt know what all the features did. 
However, after working on the prework, I think I got a bit more adjusted to it.
